# Avatar sample - Nucleo-L152RE
This folder holds an example avatar-script for the Nucleo STM32L152RE.
The application under analyses is the mbed Nucleo_printf example, compiled with the mbed online compiler.
In this demo, the device is carrying out the initilization until the main-application logic starts. At this point, the state is transferred to the emulator and execution is continued from there. To speed up this process, a post-initilization snapshot of the important parts from the devices SRAM is provided.

The script requires three files to be present:
- Nucleo_printf_NUCLEO_L152RE.bin: __This repo does not have__
- sram_after_init.bin: This file is a dump of the image after device initialization. It was generated by setting an according breakpoint with openocd and dumping the according memory.
- nucleo-l152re.cfg: The openocd configuration file

## Running the sample
```bash
python3 nucleo-l152re.py
```
